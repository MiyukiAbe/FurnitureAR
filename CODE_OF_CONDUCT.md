## Daily process

Morning standup
* New roles assigned
* Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? 
* Discuss designated any pull requests needed
* Daily Wafflemaster to add tasks to Waffle

Pair program on assigned tasks
Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
Bring up any blocking issues
* Personal issues: after 20 minutes of spinning your wheels
* Discuss/troubleshoot with group: 30 additional minutes
* Afterwards: consult fellow/instructor
At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
5pm pull request review (try to close out the day without trailing requests)

## Team expectations
Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Don’t interrupt
Share the mic
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
At least message the group when you change what you are working on

## Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
* List out the pros / cons
* Take 10-15 minute break
* Vote on it
* If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If you are frustrated
* Take a walk or get some water
* Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
* Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated 

## Git Protocol:
Commit messages should: 
* Make sure to include task name in commit message
* Be descriptive about what is being fixed
